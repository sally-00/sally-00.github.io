* Debugged and optimized the program based on paper published by a group at BMW, extending it from the original program that can only consider one car to the program that can consider all cars. On this basis, optimized the calculation time, and added the steps of screening the cars and models that need attention. (C++)
    
* Conducted performance analysis of the [Interaction-Dataset-based PREdicTion Challenge](http://challenge.interaction-dataset.com/) result, analyzed the deviation between prediction and reality, and its relationship with various features. (MATLAB)
    
* Debugged and optimized the program to increase the accuracy of identifying the interaction between vehicles. (MATLAB)
