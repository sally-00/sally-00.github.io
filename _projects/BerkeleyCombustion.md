* Argon Power Cycle
   * Carried out HCCI (Homogeneous Charged Compression Ignition) combustion experiments using natural gas under various conditions (equivalence ratio/oxygen content/compression ratio), to understand the characteristics of engine performance and emission under different conditions. 
    * Analyzed the experimental data using MATLAB. 

* Water Emulsified Diesel
    * Simulation of the combustion in the engine using CONVERGE
