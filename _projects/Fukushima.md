Attended [radiation training program](https://www.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp/ja/ev/iitate-seminar/2021/index.html) held by [Research Center for Nuclear Physics, Osaka University](https://www.rcnp.osaka-u.ac.jp/)

The program aims for deeper understanding in radiation. I attended as a member through cloud funding. 

The program includes field work in Fukushima where the nuclear disaster happened. There, we visited the still contaminated restricted sites and were able to hear a lot of information from local residents. We learned that people (even people in Japan) avoid buying food grown in Fukushima even when the radiation level is tested and shown to be safe. It is causing the food in Fukushima which used to be top delicious in Japan (eg. rice) to diminish or be sold as cheap ones.

We took some blueberry grown in Fukushima from a farmer we visited and measured the radiation level. After the analysis of the measurement, we made a poster presenting the results we got and compared it with multiple food radiation standards in the world in a way easy to understand for the symposium of the Fukushima program. For the result of the analysis, the radiation measurement of the blueberry sample showed no difference with background radiation. We also made blueberry jam from the blueberry we harvested for the audience to try out in order to call for rational choice on products made in Fukushima.
