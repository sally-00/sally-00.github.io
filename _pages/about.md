Senior student at [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en), Japan. Currenly conducting undergraduate research at [Dynamical Systems Control Lab](https://www-dsc-mech.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp/). Undergraduate thesis theme: multi-robot transportation system using flexible tactile sensor. Spent a year as an exchange student at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). There, I was involved in research of argon power cycle at Combustion Modeling Lab. Also, conducted work relating to autonomous driving including performance analysis and prediction algorithm implementation at Mechanical Systems Control Lab.

My research interests include: multi-agent system, soft robotics, bio-inspired robots, embodiment system, control theory

During spare time, I enjoy hiking, baking and watching movies.

I was born in Shanghai, China. Moved to Osaka, Japan with my family since 2012.
