- Realized cooperative object transportation with the feedback from a flexible tri-axis tactile sensor using leader follower method
- Design a multi-robot transportation system that could transport multi-joint object such as human for rescuing and conduct experiments
- Develop a robust system which robots can detect dangerous situations such as slips of the object before failure and respond to it through tactile feedback
- Explore the benefits of using flexible sensor in cooperative transportation robots
